## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to find reliable and practical recipes that actually work. Additionally, they often do not know where to seek help for culinary questions. Due to a lack of cooking knowledge and skills, many individuals rely on processed and ultra-processed foods, leading to an imbalanced diet full of preservatives and harmful ingredients.

MyRecipe aims to bridge this gap by offering a structured and interactive platform where users can:

Access tested and verified recipes
Engage with a community of home cooks and professional chefs
Improve their culinary skills with step-by-step guidance
Reduce reliance on processed foods by promoting homemade meals
By making reliable recipes and expert advice easily accessible, MyRecipe helps users build confidence in the kitchen and make healthier food choices.


## Purpose

The purpose of MyRecipe is to create a collaborative and user-friendly platform where chefs and home cooks can share tested and trustworthy recipes while enabling others to engage, learn, and ask questions.

The platform aims to:

✅ Improve Cooking Skills – Offer step-by-step guidance, culinary tips, and best practices.

✅ Promote Healthier Eating – Encourage homemade meals using fresh, natural ingredients.

✅ Foster a Cooking Community – Enable interaction through comments, Q&A, and recipe sharing.

✅ Ensure Accessibility & Simplicity – Provide an intuitive interface optimized for all devices.

Through MyRecipe, users can connect, share experiences, and adopt healthier eating habits, ultimately shifting towards wholesome, home-cooked meals that benefit overall well-being.

## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration  

The layout and visual style of MyRecipe were inspired by [Giallo Zafferano](https://www.giallozafferano.it/), a renowned Italian recipe website. Known for its vibrant colours and high-quality images, Giallo Zafferano masterfully blends art and culinary expertise, creating an engaging and visually appealing experience for food enthusiasts.  

In MyRecipe, we aimed to capture the same essence by incorporating a clean and intuitive design, rich imagery, and a warm colour palette that enhances the user’s journey through the world of cooking.

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/gerasoa/MyRecipeBook/blob/main/docs/collors.png)

### Fonts 

MyRecipes uses the [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font family to ensure a modern and elegant design. The website incorporates different variations of [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat), including regular, bold, and italic styles, to enhance readability and visual appeal.

## Future Enhancements

💡 Recipe Collections – Themed lists like "Beginner Recipes" and "Quick & Easy Meals".

💡 Meal Planning Tools – Generate weekly meal plans based on dietary preferences.


## Data Model

Overview

The MyRecipe platform uses a structured PostgreSQL database to store and manage crucial data for recipes, users, and comments. Django migrations are employed to efficiently manage schema changes and keep the database updated as the project evolves.

Data Model

The main tables in the MyRecipe database are:

📋 Users

Stores all user information, including their name, email, and password. This table handles user authentication and permissions.

🍽 Recipes

Contains recipe details such as title, ingredients, instructions, and the user who created the recipe. It also stores metadata related to the recipe's category and preparation time.

💬 Comments

Allows users to comment on recipes, sharing their feedback, questions, and tips. Each comment is tied to a specific recipe and user, fostering interaction.

📊 Database Relationships

Users ↔ Recipes: A user can create multiple recipes, but each recipe is tied to a single user.

Recipes ↔ Comments: Each recipe can have multiple comments, but each comment is linked to one recipe.

Database Diagram

Below is the diagram that illustrates the relationships between the tables in the MyRecipe database:

![Data model](https://github.com/gerasoa/MyRecipeBook/blob/main/docs/database-model.png)


## Authentication, Authorization & Access Control

MyRecipe implements role-based authentication with specific roles for users:

👤 Logged-in Users – Can browse, save, and comment on recipes.

👨‍🍳 Chefs – Can submit and manage their own recipes.

👑 Admin – Has full access to manage content, users, and the platform.

Users can log in or register via email and password. When not logged in, the Login and Register options are available. Once logged in, the Logout option appears. Admins and Chefs have exclusive access to their dedicated admin areas, while regular users can only access the public website interface.

## Testing

Test Procedures

🚀 Python Tests: Manual tests were conducted to validate the functionality, usability, and responsiveness of the application, ensuring all key features function as expected.

⚙️ W3C Validation: W3C validators were used to check the compliance of HTML and CSS with web standards, ensuring accessibility and cross-browser compatibility.

Testing Documentation
📋 Test Cases: Manual tests were performed based on specific use cases of the application, covering functionalities such as login, registration, navigation, and recipe submission.

### Known Issues 

During testing with Chrome Developer Tools, some pages showed performance issues due to the following reasons:

🔍 Insecure HTTP Requests: Cloudinary is currently serving media files over HTTP instead of HTTPS, which can make the page more vulnerable and trigger security warnings.

🔍 Third-Party Cookies: A significant number of third-party cookies were detected, which may impact performance and security.

These issues were identified and addressed but could not be fully resolved in time for this version. They will be fixed in future updates.


## Version Control & Secure Code Management

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Heroku and is accessible at:

[My Recipes Book](https://my-recipes-book-5149219e370b.herokuapp.com/)

### 🛠 Deployment Process

The deployment was carried out using Heroku with the following steps:

1 - Prepare the application

 - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 - Set `DEBUG = False` for production.

 - Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the Heroku app domain.

2 - Set up environment variables

The following variables were added to Heroku:

- CLOUDINARY_URL – For media storage

- DATABASE_URL – For database connection

- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 – To prevent static file collection issues

- SECRET_KEY – To ensure application security

3 - Deploy to Heroku

- Create a new Heroku app: heroku create my-recipes-book

- Set environment variables: heroku config:set VAR_NAME=value

- Push the project:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push heroku main
```

- Run database migrations: `heroku run python manage.py migrate`


## 🔒 Security Measures

✔ `SECRET_KEY` and other sensitive credentials are stored securely as environment variables.

✔ `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files.

✔ `DEBUG = False` in production to enhance security.


## ✅ Deployment Verification

After deployment, the application was tested to ensure:

- The functionality matches the local development version.

- Database connections and media storage work correctly.

- The UI and interactive features operate as expected.


## AI Assistance in Development 🤖

During the development of this project, I strategically used GitHub Copilot to assist in various aspects of the code creation process. Here’s how AI contributed:

1 - Code Creation & Refinement:

Copilot helped generate parts of the code, especially in complex areas, and suggested improvements for better code structure and readability. It also assisted in refining classes and optimizing the CSS for better organization.

Bug Detection & Fixing:

2 -  I encountered some bugs in the code, which were identified and corrected with the help of AI. Copilot played a crucial role in pinpointing semantic errors and suggesting corrections, ensuring smoother functionality.

3 - Content Creation & Testing:

AI also contributed to generating content for the site and testing core functionalities. This was particularly valuable in ensuring that key features were working as expected.

4 - Productivity & Efficiency Gains:

The use of AI drastically reduced development time, allowing for quicker debugging, content generation, and code optimization. The overall impact on productivity was significant, and I was able to focus on higher-level tasks with improved efficiency.

# MyRecipe - Project Overview

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to find reliable and practical recipes that actually work. Additionally, they often do not know where to seek help for culinary questions.

Access tested and verified recipes
Engage with a community of home cooks and professional chefs
Improve their culinary skills with step-by-step guidance

## Data Model

Overview

The MyRecipe platform uses a structured PostgreSQL database to store and manage crucial data for recipes, users, and comments. Django migrations are employed to efficiently manage schema changes and keep the database updated as the project evolves.

Data Model

The main tables in the MyRecipe database are:

📋 Users

Stores all user information, including their name, email, and password. This table handles user authentication and permissions.

🍽 Recipes

Contains recipe details such as title, ingredients, instructions, and the user who created the recipe. It also stores metadata related to the recipe's category and preparation time.

💬 Comments

Allows users to comment on recipes, sharing their feedback, questions, and tips. Each comment is tied to a specific recipe and user, fostering interaction.

📊 Database Relationships

Users ↔ Recipes: A user can create multiple recipes, but each recipe is tied to a single user.
Recipes ↔ Comments: Each recipe can have multiple comments, but each comment is linked to one recipe.
